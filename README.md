## Introduction
The objective of this application is to enable students to quickly and easily find help through a simple platform. Students can define a topic of study, a duration for their session and a university to search for available tutors. A tutor can sign up and check in to the platform to announce their availability to students. Once a tutor is available, they can accept incoming requests from Students for a tutoring session. The motivation for this project is to improve the remote learning experience for Students in high school and university by improving ease of access to learning services.
